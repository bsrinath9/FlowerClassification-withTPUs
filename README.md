# ***Flower Classification with TPUs***

***Herambeshwar Pendyala  | Srinath Botsa***

***course project-2 for cs795 - Practical Machine Learning | Yaohang Li***


### Requirements to run the program

- python 3.7 with anaconda
- numpy
- pandas
- scikitlearn
- pickle
- random
- seaborn
- matplotlib
- TensorFlow
- Keras
- efficientNet

***Note***
- All the above mentioned libraries can be downloaded from anaconda packages.
- for efficientNet, we need to follow steps mentioned in the [EfficientNet lib](https://pypi.org/project/efficientnet/) .


### Files and directories

- cs795-p2-flower-classification-presentation.ipynb     - Jupyter Notebook with all the presentation code
- Ensemble(Dense+Efficient) + LR schedule.ipynb         - Jupyter Notebook with DenseNet EfficientNet and ensemble code.
- getting-started-with-100-flowers-on-tpu-Initial.ipynb - Sample Starter Code.
- run-resnet-scratch-in-tpu.ipynb                       - Resnet From Scratch Code.
- models - Directory for saved models. # as the models size is more than 250 mb we have not included the saved models 
- submissions - Contains submitted csv file.
- images - saved images from notebook.

> Once all the dependecies are clear and installed, open cs795-p2-flower-classification-presentation.ipynb and execute cell by cell.  
> For running starter Code, open getting-started-with-100-flowers-on-tpu-Initial.ipynb and execute cell by cell.
> For Resnet open and run, run-resnet-scratch-in-tpu.ipynb 
> for DenseNet, EfficientNet and ensemble implementation, open Ensemble(Dense+Efficient) + LR schedule.ipynb and run each cell

- Average Runtime of each notebook is nearly 2 to 2.5 hrs
